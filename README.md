# Heart-Disease-Analysis-Dashboard
# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

A data-driven Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize patient survival trends, heart-related health factors, and the impact of clinical parameters on heart disease outcomes.


## 🚀 Project Overview
This dashboard provides a **comprehensive analysis of heart disease data**, focusing on patient survival rates, risk factors, and medical indicators such as ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and comorbidities (smoking, diabetes, anaemia, and hypertension).

The goal is to uncover **patterns that influence survival** and enable healthcare professionals and data analysts to make more informed decisions.



## 🎯 Business Objective
To analyze patient data and:
- Identify key factors that affect heart disease survival.
- Understand demographic patterns (age, gender) impacting outcomes.
- Evaluate the relationship between **clinical parameters** and **death events**.
- Enable data-driven strategies for early intervention and prevention.


## 🩺 Key Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Survival Rate** | Percentage of patients who survived heart disease events |
| **Average Age of Survival** | Mean age of patients who survived |
| **Total Survival** | Number of patients who survived |
| **Total Deaths** | Number of patients who did not survive |
| **Ejection Fraction** | Heart’s pumping efficiency; lower values indicate higher risk |
| **Serum Creatinine** | Marker of kidney function; higher levels correlate with higher mortality |
| **Comorbidities** | Impact of smoking, diabetes, anaemia, and high blood pressure |


## 📊 Dashboard Insights
- 💓 **Overall Survival Rate:** 67.89%  
- 👥 **Average Survival Age:** 58.76 years  
- ⚰️ **Total Deaths:** 96 out of 299 total cases  
- 📈 **Highest Survival:** Patients aged **51–60** (75.9%)  
- 📉 **Lowest Survival:** Patients aged **71+** (40.38%)  
- 🔬 **Key Factors:** Higher serum creatinine and lower ejection fraction are associated with higher mortality.  
- 🚬 **Lifestyle Impact:** Smoking, anaemia, and high blood pressure significantly affect survival in older groups.  


## 🧠 Analytical Highlights
- **Younger groups (below 40)** show fewer deaths but smaller data representation.  
- **Ejection fraction** decreases with age and correlates with death count.  
- **Serum creatinine** increases with age, indicating potential kidney function decline in non-survivors.  
- **Comorbidities** like hypertension and anaemia show higher concentration in the 51–70 age groups.  



## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard design  
- **DAX** – Calculated measures and KPIs  
- **Excel / CSV Dataset** – Data preparation and transformation  
- **Data Modeling** – Relationships between patient data tables  



## 🩸 Visuals in Dashboard
- Card visuals for **Survival Rate**, **Total Death**, **Avg Age of Survival**  
- Bar + Line combo charts for **Death Count vs Ejection Fraction** and **Serum Creatinine**  
- Line chart for **Survival Rate by Age Group**  
- Ribbon chart for **Impact of Lifestyle Diseases**  
- Gender-based slicer for demographic segmentation
